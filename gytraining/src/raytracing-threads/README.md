Multithreaded Performance: UCLA CS35L Assignment 8
=====================

Improve "srt" - a ray tracing program in C - to support multithreading, and thus improve its performance on multicore processors.

### How to run the program
- <code>cd</code> into the program directory; then <code>make</code> to generate the executable file.
- <code>./srt -N</code> to run, where <code>-N</code> is the number of threads using.
- <code>make clean check</code> outputs four ray tracing images calculated by 1, 2, 4 and 8 threads.
