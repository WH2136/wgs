《How Linux RT_PREEMPT Works》
      The cost of the increased determinism of real time
        - Increased average latency
        - Decreased throughput
        
      Enabling real-time Linux
        - preemptible kernel
        - locking
        - threaded interrupt handlers
        - threaded softirq
        
      CONFIG_PREEMPT “fully preemptible”
        - except when preemption is explicitly disabled
        - except when interrupts are explicitly disabled
        - except when a lock is held
        (“in a critical section”)
        
       Impact of Real-Time Features
            + Variance of real-time task latency decreased
            + Maximum real-time task latency decreased
            - Average real-time task latency may be increased
            - Throughput decreased
